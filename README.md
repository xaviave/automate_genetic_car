# automate_genetic_car

Wrap with a genetic algorithm, the main mission for a dataless "car" is to drive from a point A to a point B.
Power supply is also a big parameter for every car, the consumation will be calculated.
With repetition, random and selection, the car have to "evolve" and adapt itself to any road.

New version: v0.1, angle correction

## Track generator

To train these little evolutive car we need to create random playground. Cars like road but not grass so I star with this.

`xtrack.py` is a minimal track creator with color with signification obviously and a pattern for road that cross a SVG file.
Options are used to create complexity because our cars will be better and better.
There is a track generator `ReadMe` in *srcs/TrackUtils/*

## Car's functioning

To begin the process, I will let the car know every function then, let the car test and adapt parameter to self drive it

### Car components

#### Headlight

the light light up the map following it's range and angle.

Generate a map with light efficiency for the sensor.

#### Sensor

Thanks to the light map generated by the headlight, the sensor can detect in the light up map part.

The car position and direction are used as referencial for the sensor angle.

Generate a sensor map that show the "good" place to good for the car. 

#### Motor

The main motor function is to move the car along a vector with a variable magnetude.

The direction of the vector is define by the angle processed by the car's turn function.

## Power supply

The main problematic is to define the power consumption of every component or function here to simulate a electric car.
The weight and aerodynamic of the car have to count in the calculus.
The battery stockage and power supply need to be given as parameter to allow different simulation type.
Stop the car when there's no more power allow a new good parameter to test and create car.
